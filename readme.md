Disclaimer
----------

This is a small project I started just to learn a bit of javascript and knockout.js so the code does probabAly not comply to best practices. It needs major refactoring and reviewing, but it can be used as is. It was designed with Slurm as a resource manager in mind, (and adapted later for other resource managers) so the vocabulary is very Slurm-related.
